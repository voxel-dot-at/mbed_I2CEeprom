/// Class to provide simple access to I2C EEPROM chiles like Microchip's 24LC range
/// or AMTELS AT24C range.

/// The class handles multiple page writes so any amount of data can be written in
/// a single call to write. The writes are not buffered so additional memory use
/// is kept to a minimum.
///
/// Although not tested it should work with the MAC versions of Microchip range
/// as well but the chipSize will need to be set to include the ROM area as well.
